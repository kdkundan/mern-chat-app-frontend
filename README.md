# MERN React Chat App - Frontend

This project is a chat application built using Vite, React, Chakra UI, ReduxJS Toolkit, TanStack Query, and Axios. It offers a modern, efficient, and scalable way to build a real-time chat application.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It serves your code via native ES Module imports during development, enabling a fast hot module replacement (HMR).

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create reusable UI components.

- **Chakra UI**: A simple, modular, and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks to build your React applications.

- **ReduxJS Toolkit**: The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. It simplifies store setup, reduces boilerplate code, and provides best practices out-of-the-box.

- **TanStack Query**: A powerful data synchronization library for React that enables fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating server state in your applications.

- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It makes it easy to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations.
